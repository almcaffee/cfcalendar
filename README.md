# [CFCalendar](http://ollietinsley.com/coldfusion/calendar-git.cfm)
Builds calendar month | Coldfusion

This was created solely because I created a dashboard application running on CF and wanted a fairly large viewable calendar without the headaches of css styling issues of a js framework.

CSS included to differentiate leading/trailing days and display some possible functionality.
