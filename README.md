# cfcalendar
Builds calendar month | Coldfusion

This is intend to build a calendar application without javascript. I understand that .js is better suited for fronteend. This was created solely because I created a dashboard application running of Lucee and wanted a fairly large viewable calendar without the headaches of styling issues in a java framework.

CSS included to differentiate leading/trailing days and display some functionality this coud possibly have.
